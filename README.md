# Supervised Learning: YouTube Views Prediction Project

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the number of views a YouTube video will receive based on various descriptive features.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the "Trending YouTube Video Statistics" collection on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new).

## Project Instructions

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform an exploratory analysis to understand the data's characteristics.
- Generate visualizations to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships that could inform our model.

### 2. Data Pre-processing
- Document the pre-processing steps taken to prepare the data for modeling.
- Provide rationales for each pre-processing decision.

### 3. Data Splitting
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Explain the choice of split ratio.

### 4. Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Construct and fine-tune various machine learning models.
- Select the best model based on performance metrics, and justify this choice.

### 5. Model Testing
- Assess the chosen model's performance using the test set.
- Discuss the predictive performance and any insights gained from the model.

## Team Behind This Project
